 *Explain what a token is used for.
    A token is a piece of data that has no meaning or use on its own, 
    but combined with the correct tokenization system, becomes a vital player in securing your application. 
    Token based authentication works by ensuring that each request to a server is accompanied by a signed 
    token which the server verifies for authenticity and only then responds to the request.

*What steps can you take in your web apps to keep your data secure?


*Describe how web servers work.
    The “world wide web” (which we’ll refer to as “the web”) is just a part of the internet - which is itself a network of interconnected computers.

    It consists of a body of information stored on web servers, ready to be shared across the world.

*Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.

    PUT takes in a body object like POST and we use that object to identify data that needs to be updated somewhere.
